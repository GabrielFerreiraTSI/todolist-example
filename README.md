# todolist-example
 A API todolist made in Node js, Express and EJS. You can get this code to train your skills.

## Important instructions
This API needs some Node dependences to work as Express, Body Parser and EJS.

This is important check if the Node js is installed in your PC, because without Node js, it's impossible to test your API.

Before get this code to train, it's necessary have knowledge in Javascript first, beacause Node js works too much with Javascript to frontend and backend.

If you have the Node js and did not install the Node dependences yet, open your terminal, search your project folder and type 'cd folder-name'. In this folder, you should be install all the necessary Node dependences to run your API and do tests. First type 'npm init -y' in your terminal to create a JSON package, this file will have a 'env' according of your API functionality.

After to create the JSON package, we'll do install the dependences, typing 'npm i express', 'npm i body-parser' and 'npm i ejs'. It's important to understand that when we install a dependence for example as Express, we create a JSON package-lock according of installed dependences. 

However, when you run or test your API, open your terminal and type 'node index.js', if your file 'index.js' is setted as main in file JSON package, this file will be run.

Hint 1: If you want to do serie tests, install the node module Nodemon typing 'npm i nodemon', create two variables as "start":"npm run index.js" and "dev":"nodemon run index.js" in JSON package in "scripts".
Hint 2: To cancel any process, press CTRL+C and to clear the terminal screen, press CTRL+L. 

Good training!
